   <h3>”More about me…”</h3>
   <ul>
      <li> I want to major in computer science because I love working with computers and I want to learn more about how they work and what languages they understand + how those languages work</li>
      <li> If computer programming doesn't work out, I would like to do something medical related such as being an anesthesiologist or even a plastic surgeon so I can make that $$$$$</li>
      <li> My favorite thing to do is listen to music and watch YouTube</li>
      <li> I'm also really interested in improving my skills at the bass so I can start a band in case the medical career or the computer programming career doesn't work out. ^_^</li>
      <li> My favorite bands are Bring Me The Horizon, Sleeping with Sirens, and Panic! At The Disco (scroll over each picture to know which band is which)</li>
